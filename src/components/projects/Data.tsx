    title: 'Cannabis Treatment Optimizer - Helping Patients Find What Works',
    description:
      'Built an AI system that helps medical cannabis patients find the right treatment faster. Think of it like Netflix recommendations, but for medical treatments. The system learned from 1.4 million real patient experiences to predict which cannabis strains will work best for each person\'s specific symptoms. Before this, patients had to try dozens of products through trial and error - now they get personalized recommendations instantly. The result? Patients found effective treatments 25% more often and avoided products that wouldn\'t help them.',

    description:
      'Created an AI assistant that handles repetitive tasks for a cannabis analytics company. It\'s like having a super-smart intern that never sleeps. The AI answers customer questions, manages inventory levels, sends alerts when products run low, and creates reports automatically. What used to take employees hours now happens instantly, letting the team focus on helping customers instead of paperwork.',

    title: 'Real Estate Price Predictor for Home Builders',
    description:
      'Built a system that predicts future home and land prices for a real estate development company. It\'s like having a crystal ball for property values. The system combines data from 37 different sources - everything from school ratings to crime statistics to job growth - and predicts what properties will be worth 5, 10, even 15 years from now. This helps the company buy land in areas that will grow in value and avoid areas that won\'t.',

    description:
      'Led the complete rebuild of data systems for Senturus, a major consulting firm. Imagine trying to find information when it\'s scattered across 30 different filing cabinets - that was their problem. I built a single, organized system where everyone could find what they needed instantly. Set up proper security so people only see what they\'re allowed to see, and made sure the data was always accurate and up-to-date.',

      'Created a tool that lets Claude (the AI assistant) directly access and analyze business data in Microsoft systems. It\'s like giving Claude the keys to your company\'s data warehouse. Instead of manually pulling reports and copying data, you can just ask Claude questions in plain English and get instant answers with live data.
